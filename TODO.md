# To-Do list
## 1
Rewrite the keyboard driver so it just copies the key and keycode into a struct, and have the terminal handle the rest.

## 2
Redo the IDT code so it is similar to Bran's, because our IDT implementation is not the best.

## 3
Add code to CPU.cpp that allows us to switch to 16 bit mode.

## 4
Add code in the graphics.cpp that lets us set the resolution, while maintaining an abstraction with the print functions.

## 5
Complete code rewrite, fixing little and big things from earlier.
